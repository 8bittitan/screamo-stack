        Thank you for helping to improve the Remix Sceamo Stack!

        Our bandwidth on maintaining this stack is limited. As a single dev, I'm
        trying my best to get to any issues. The good news is you can
        fork and adjust this stack however you'd like and start using it today
        as a custom stack. Learn more from
        [the Remix Stacks docs](https://remix.run/stacks).

        If you'd still like to report a bug, please fill out this form. I can't
        promise a timely response, but hopefully when I have the bandwidth to
        work on this stack again I can take a look. Thanks!
